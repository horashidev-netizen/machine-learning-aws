Understand the Use Case

In this lab, we’ll build an application using Amazon Bedrock Flows that provides an immersive and personalized learning experience on AWS. We’ll leverage the foundation models in Bedrock to enable learners to ask detailed questions about AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, and RDS and receive clear, tailored explanations. These AI-powered insights simplify complex cloud concepts and adapt to the user’s level of expertise.

We’ll connect user queries to a curated knowledge base to enhance the hands-on learning experience, offering step-by-step guidance on real-world AWS tasks. For example, we’ll provide:

Access to relevant labs to the learners using Amazon Knowledge Base.

Simplify complex deployment scenarios using Bedrock Agents.
