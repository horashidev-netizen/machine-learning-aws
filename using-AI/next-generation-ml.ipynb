    "# Deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning. Deep learning represents a huge leap forward in the capabilities of AI/ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the theory for deep learning goes back decades, the hardware required to run deep learning problems wasn’t generally accessible until recently. Now that it’s available, you can use deep learning to address more complex problems than ever before.\n",

    "*Euler diagram with deep learning inside machine learning, which is inside AI.*\n",
    "*Diagram of artificial neurons, connections and activation functions in the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning algorithms learn using artificial neural networks (ANNs), which were inspired by the human brain. These ANNs contain layers of artificial neurons (math functions) that mimic real human neurons. Each layer of artificial neurons summarizes and feeds information to the next layer until a final model is produced. During this training process, the algorithm derives the features itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep learning use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four broad categories of deep learning use cases as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Computer vision\n",
    "*   Speech recognition\n",
    "*   Natural language processing\n",
    "*   Recommendation engines\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following diagram illustrates how a computer vision deep learning algorithm learns to categorize an image. To learn how the layers of this artificial neural network function, choose each of the five numbered markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Diagram with image of dog in the input layer, three hidden layers, and the word dog in the output layer. Details in markers.*\n",

    "# Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "*Euler diagram with generative AI inside deep learning, which is inside machine learning.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is a type of deep learning that can create new content and ideas, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conversations\n",
    "*   Stories\n",
    "*   Images\n",
    "*   Videos\n",
    "*   Music\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is powered by very large machine learning models that are pre-trained on vast collections of unlabeled data. These are commonly called foundation models (FMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Diagram of traditional ML models training on labeled data for specific tasks compared to one FM training on unlabeled data and being adapted for all the tasks. Details in caption.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of gathering labeled data for each model and training multiple models, you can use the same pre-trained foundation model to adapt to multiple tasks. You can customize FMs to perform domain-specific functions, using only a small fraction of the data and compute power required to train a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Large language models\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are a popular type of foundation model. LLMs are trained on a vast amount of text data, such as books, websites, and conversations. This input data helps foundation models learn how language works so they can generate human-like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple use cases for large language models. They include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Copywriting**: LLMs can write original copy or improve the style and voice of existing sentences.\n",
    "*   **Knowledge base answering**: LLMs can answer specific questions related to knowledge bases.\n",
    "*   **Text classification**: LLMs can classify text with similar meanings or sentiments, such as measuring customer sentiment.\n",
    "*   **Code generation**: LLMs are proficient in code generation from natural language prompts. For example, Amazon Q Developer can generate code in multiple languages, such as Python, TypeScript, and Java.\n",
    "*   **Text generation**: LLMs can generate new text. Examples include finishing incomplete sentences, creating product documentation, and writing stories."
